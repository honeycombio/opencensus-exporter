# This project is no longer under development!

This project is not actively maintained and you should not use it. New issues and pull requests will likely be ignored. OpenCensus has been superseded by OpenTelementry.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) can read & write multiple trace formats and is the preferred alternative.

## Honeycomb and OpenCensus
